# Text Shadow Generator

A graphical user interface for generating CSS styles for three-dimensional text-shadows.

## About

I originally created this project with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and SCSS to build something original without following a tutorial. The original version will be re-uploaded in the future as a reference.

This version (v2) was built with Create React App to help me improve my React knowledge. I ended up going with standard CSS for the styling because I mainly use Styled Components and SCSS at work and on other projects.
